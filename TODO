Wishlist:

- Support for OOB command to/from client.  This way we perhaps can
  send some control commands to the master instead of the pty.

- Count lines, not blocks.

- Support for CR to overwrite output lines / limited screen mode.

- Client which is capable of sending ^C etc. (without bad tricks) from
  the command line to the pty.

- Terminate (HUP) in case the unix socket is removed. (Watch inode)

- Remove socket on close.  "Remove by rename."

- When daemonizing parent shall give error status of main

- Main shall wait for child fork somehow, too, to tell of impossible
  forks.  Perhaps this can be done with a pipe with flag set to
  close-on-exec (so it's closed if exec successful).

Possibly:

- Refork client if client terminates.  However unsure how to deal with
  daemonizing, as CWD then is changed to / and first fork must then
  always be delayed.
