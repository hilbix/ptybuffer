- Add debugging/logging option, such that scripting problems can be
  detected more easily than now.

- Support for OOB command to/from client.  This way we perhaps can
  send some control commands to the master instead of the pty.

- Gracefully abort client sockets on EOF of pty process.

- Implement non-deamonized mode such that you can use ptybuffer from
  /etc/inittab

- Options instead of hardcoded values (ECHO, History-Size)

- Count lines, not blocks.

- Support for CR to overwrite output lines / limited screen mode.

- Client which is capable of sending ^C etc. (without bad tricks) from
  the command line to the pty.
