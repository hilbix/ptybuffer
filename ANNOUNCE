64 bit bugfix, option -i and -k, ptybufferconnect now sends to stdout

After some searching I found where the presentation bug hid.  Also the
last bugfix disabled option -t (which did not work correctly before I
think).  This version here shall fix all that now.  With option -i and
-k this can be considered a 0.6.0.  However ptybufferconnect is not
yet as complete as I would like to see it.

Also ptybufferconnect now writes data to stdout (before it was stdin,
oops).
