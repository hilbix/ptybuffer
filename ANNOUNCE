Ptybufferconnect a little bit more usable, new options plus minor
update release.  Added the php/ subdirectory for web based shell demo.

The tool ptybufferconnect now starts to do something reasonable.  It
is far from beeing read yet, though.  Interactive mode is still
missing.

This version uses the latest internal changes in my library, so it is
- again - somewhat experimental.  Use 0.5.10 if you have trouble, this
version is considered stable.

Option -p was added for timestamping in the output logfile (-o).  Also
option -q was added so that ptybuffer now by default prints some info.
