Important bugfix and minor change in bin/autostart.sh for better
logging control

I found a serious bug in my sock_select function in case
of foced poll operation.  It is unknown if ptybuffer was
affected, however I think some unreliablilities might
be present in former version.

However there was (as always) many changes on other places
in my lib, so I am not sure (yet) if this version is more
stable than before.
