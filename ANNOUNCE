Slight improvements

New tinolib shall help with "make distclean; make" on Debian Sarge

stdin now can be the controlling socket or can be treated as "the
first connect".

Option -n to give the history length.

As always this version is nearly untested.
If you have trouble revert to previous version,
it's successfully in productive use for a long time now.
