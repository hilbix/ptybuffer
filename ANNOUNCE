Logfiles, can run in foreground, options added and minor bugfix

WARNING!  Version is nearly untested.

ptybuffer was extended to accept options.  It now can run from
/etc/inittab or deamontools and has support to write logfiles, too.
Please see the help which comes when ptybuffer is called without any
argument.

A little bug was fixed which could cause data transferred to the
terminal to wait in ptybuffer until new data arrives to the terminal.

Additional note: The NWNadm part in this version was removed.  It will
show up as an independent package in future.
