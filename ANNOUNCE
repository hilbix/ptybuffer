Mainly updated NWNadm

NWNadm starts to become usable.  File upload/download is implemented,
but due to missing dabase support there is no connection between the
upload directory and the NWN server, except you do it yourself.

There is limited Mozilla support, too.
However it looks like Mozilla, like IE, needs a multi-connection-patch,
which I did not find out yet how to do.  So with Mozilla you can only
have one of the running windows open in parallel.

This means, if you have more than one server, NWNadm does not work well
with Mozilla for now.
