Bufix and minor improvement release.

DO NOT USE VERSION 0.5.9!  Use 0.5.8 or 0.5.10 instead.

I moved SIGPIPE out of main and just ignored it in the part which goes
away for daemonizing.  Apparently SIGPIPE must be ignored in the
resident part, too, as it sometimes shows up.  Dunno why.  Also dunno
why the program just goes away (SIG_DFL?).  Now SIGPIPE shall no more
make trouble.

A second bug was, when it came to logging.  The argument '-' (log/out
to stderr/out) was no more correctly processed for logfiles.  Also
another change now is, that logging by default is turned off
completely, so you must enable it and use '-' if you want the old
(intermediate, I think it wasn't there from the beginning) behavior.

The minor improvement is, that ptybuffer now hands out the number of
skipped bytes at the beginning, to ease script development to
re-attach to ptybuffer.  Still not perfect though, there shall be some
better way to negotiate content positions.

Also some minor changes to reflect the new library routine names.

This version is released even more early to fix the bug, so it's
nearly untested.
