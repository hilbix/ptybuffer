ptybuffer was designed to get rid of screen/expect constructs to improve
stability.  It deamonizes programs which need a tty/pty to operate.  Unix
domain sockets then can connect, send lines to the program and receive the
output (with history) of the program in real time.

It's (again) in the alpha phase.
NWNadm has been removed and will show up as an idependent package.

Example how to fork off a web based emergency shell with ptybuffer
<b>(this is a extreme security risk if you don't protect it!)</b>:
<pre>
copy the nwn part (see 0.2.x) into ~/public_html/shell/
ptybuffer ~/public_html/shell/server/shell /bin/bash
point your browser to
http://your.server.name/~yourlogin/shell/all.php?port=shell
</pre>
If you don't understand this, don't even try it.  It's too dangerous!
