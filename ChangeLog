	* ptybuffer.c (main): cd /
	(sock_process, master_process, deamonloop): on close the socket is
	destroyed and freed, so I cannot check against the file
	descriptor.  Close-handling corrected.

	* ptybuffer.c: ECHO_SEND now is no more the default (it's stupid,
	"stty echo" and "stty -echo" are much better).

	* stress.sh: Well, there is a strange bug.  The stress.sh script
	only loops less than 1000 times.  Looking why.  Note that you need
	my "accept" to be reachable in path to use the stress script.
	Weird.  I cannot prove the problem under RedHat 9 on my 466 MHz
	Celeron develop machine.  However on one of my fast SuSE 9 servers
	it segfaults within seconds.  Oh well, thanks to gdb, I see
	.. it's a memory issue, realloc cores, sigh.  OK, setting
	environment variable MALLOC_CHECK_=1 shows that I have some
	serious memory corruption, hunting down .. Found with -lefence.

	* ptybuffer.c (master_process): on CLOSE we need to close the
	master, not free the user pointer.  Just cosmetic, as when the
	master closes everything will terminate anyway.

	* ChangeLog: started
